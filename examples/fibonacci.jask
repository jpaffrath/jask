; this example shows how to implement a fibonacci calculation in jask

store 0 in first
store 1 in second
store 0 in next
store 0 in max

print("Enter number: ")
assign read() to max
convert max to number

run i from 0 to max with i plus 1
	if i smallerequals 1
		assign i to c
	else
		assign first plus second to next
		assign second to first
		assign next to second
	endif

	printLine(next)
